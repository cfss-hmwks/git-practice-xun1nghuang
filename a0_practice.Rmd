## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Better plots!

Here, we're going to use tidyverse (which has ggplot2)

```{r plot-cars}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mtcars)+ 
       geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = wt, 
                      color = factor(cyl),
                      shape = factor(cyl),
                      size = hp))+ 
                      #label = rownames(mtcars), check_overlap = TRUE) +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("coral1", "cyan1", "aquamarine2") ) +
  labs(title = "Car MPG vs weight", 
       x = 'Miles per gallon',
       y = 'Car weight',
       shape="Cylinders", size="Horsepower", color = "Cylinders",
       caption = "Source: mtcars")

```

###Gapminder Example
```{r}
library(gapminder)
data(gapminder)
str(gapminder)
```

###To Mtcars

```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars)

ggplot(mtcars)+
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = wt, 
                 color = factor(cyl),
                 shape = factor(cyl),
                 size = hp))+
  labs(title = "Car MPG vs weight", 
       x = 'Miles per gallon',
       y = 'Car weight',
       shape="Cylinders", size="Horsepower", color = "Cylinders",
       caption = "Source: mtcars") +
  theme_bw()+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "gray", "blue") )
```
